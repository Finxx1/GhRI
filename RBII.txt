The RBII (Repository Build & Install Instructions) file specification

Description:
    The RBII file format specifies how to compile and install software without requiring human intervention. Currently, we are planning on supporting Python and C.

Format: YAML

Variables 
    Lang            Specifies the programming language used in the project in lowercase.
(O) Compiler        Specifies the name of the compiler used.
(O) Interpreter     Specifies the name of the interpreter used.
(O) Dependancies    Specifies any dependancies used.
    Source          Specifies any source files that need to be passed to the compiler.
(O) Flags           Specifies any additional compiler flags to be passed.

(O) MacInstallDir   Specifies the directory to place binaries on macOS.
(O) MacInstallCMD   Specifies any additional commands to run via macOS. If the command requires super-user permission, GhRI will prompt the user for the admin password.
(O) WinInstallDir   Specifies the directory to place binaries on NT Windows.
(O) WinInstallCMD   Specifies any additional commands to run via Windows. If the command requires admin privileges, GhRI will prompt the user for the admin password.
(O) LinuxInstallDir Specifies the directory to place binaries on Linux.
(O) LinuxInstallCMD   Specifies any additional commands to run via Linux. If the command requires super-user permission, GhRI will prompt the user for the admin password.
(O) UnixInstallDir  Specifies the directory to place binaries on Unix-like OS's.
(O) UnixInstallCMD  Specifies any additional commands to run on this Unix machine. If the command requires admin privileges, GhRI will prompt the user for the admin password.
(O) DosInstallDir   Specifies the directory to place binaries on Non-NT Windows OS's.
(O) DosInstallCMD   Specifies any additional commands to run via DOS.

An implementation of RBII is invalid if any of the following conditions are met:
    The implementation stores admin passwords.
    The implementation does not require the `Source` or `Lang` variables to be set
    The implementation requires install instructions, compiler/interpreter definitions, dependancies, and/or flags.
    The implementation does not run the commands via the default shell.
